    <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
    <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms<br>
    up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away.<br>
    When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with<br>
    crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life.<br>
    Namaste.</p>
